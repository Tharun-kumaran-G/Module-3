## SEB - FIND SEQUENCES OF LOWER CASE LETTERS JOINED WITH '#'

---

### AIM  
To write a Python program to find sequences of Lower case letters joined with a '#'.

---

### ALGORITHM

1. Import the `re` (regular expressions) module.
2. Take a string input from the user.
3. Use `re.fullmatch()` to check if the string matches the pattern `[a-z]*#+[a-z]+`.
4. If it matches, print "Found a match!".
5. Otherwise, print "Not matched!".
